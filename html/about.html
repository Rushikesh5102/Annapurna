        <!-- Problem Statement Section -->
        <section class="problem section">
            <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>In India, there is a significant gap between the demand for authentic, homemade traditional food and its availability, particularly for working professionals, students, and individuals living away from their hometowns. Urbanization has led to an over-reliance on fast food, while culturally rooted, home-cooked meals are becoming less accessible. Meanwhile, skilled home chefs, especially housewives with deep knowledge of traditional recipes, lack a platform to showcase their culinary talents and reach a wider audience.</p>
            <p>The need arises for a solution that connects consumers with authentic homemade meals, empowers home chefs, and provides access to regional ingredients—preserving culinary heritage while offering convenient, culturally rich food experiences.</p>

        <!-- Solution Section -->
        <section class="solution section">
            <h1>Our Solution</h1>
            <p>The Indian food market, particularly in urban areas, is flooded with quick-service restaurants and fast-food chains that cater to convenience but often lack the authenticity and health benefits of traditional home-cooked meals. For individuals who have migrated to cities for education or work, the option of enjoying their regional delicacies is scarce, creating a cultural and culinary disconnect. Many people long for the taste of their hometown's dishes, especially those passed down through generations, which cannot be replicated by commercial outlets.</p>
            <p>Moreover, despite a growing interest in cooking traditional dishes, sourcing genuine, region-specific spices and ingredients is a challenge for home cooks. Many traditional recipes require specialized spices that are often unavailable in standard supermarkets, resulting in subpar versions of the dishes.</p>
            <p>Our solution connects these home chefs with consumers seeking authentic meals and regional ingredients, addressing both demand and supply while celebrating India’s rich culinary diversity.</p>
